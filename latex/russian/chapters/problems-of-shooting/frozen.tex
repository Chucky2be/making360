\problem

{\large The camera keeps freezing up! \par}

The camera froze halfway through recording and the LCD monitor is stuck. Pressing buttons does nothing. Is the camera dead? Is all the footage lost?! 


\solution

{\large Remove the battery or change the microSD card. \par}

Don’t worry, your previous footage will still be there. The take the camera got stuck on may or may not have recorded up to the moment it failed. However, all your previous takes should be uncorrupted. GoPros will get stuck due to software issues or the microSD card. 

First try turning the camera off by holding down the MODE button for 10 seconds. 
If this doesn’t work, then take the battery out and put it back in. If that doesn't solve it, then make sure the camera is OFF and take the microSD card out to see determine if it is a software or card issue. If the microSD card doesn't have the proper write speed then it might not be able to keep up with recording.
