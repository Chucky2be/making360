\problem

{\large Which brand and size of microSD cards should you purchase? \par}

Nike vs Adidas. FujiFilm vs Kodak. SanDisk vs Lexar. 


\solution

{\large Sell out and go with the name brand GoPro endorsed and recommended cards. \par}

Use the same make of memory cards for all the cameras. You want all the cameras as identical as possible so the microSD cards matter as well. Get the cards with the fastest read/write speeds. The cards with fastest write speed will perform better in the cameras. Also having the fastest read speed will minimize file transfer time. Spend more money on the higher class cards since they will last longer as well. 

The SanDisk Extreme PLUS 64 GB or Lexar 633x 64 GB is recommended.

You need the cards with the fastest read/write speeds because when you shoot with a high resolution video mode on the GoPro cameras, then you are obviously dumping alot of data onto the memory card! So if you buy a knockoff memory card and the write speeds aren't up to snuff, then the camera buffer will fill up and will stop recording prematurely.
