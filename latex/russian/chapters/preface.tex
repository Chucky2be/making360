{\itshape\bfseries "THE WELL.
\\
the town may be changed,
\\
but the well cannot be changed.
\\
it neither decreases nor increases
\\
they come and go and draw from the well
\\
\\
structures change, but the life of man with its needs remains
\\
eternally the sameâ€”this cannot be changed. life is also inexhaustible. 
\\
it grows neither less nor more; it exists for one and for all...
\\
the foundations of human nature are the same in everyone."

}

we know technology will evolve exponentially, softwares will update, hardware will become smaller, lighter, and more efficient. the chapters we have written thus far could be irrelevant as of yesterday. so please continually constantly self-develop with us. 

we want this book to be a town well, a reservoir of resources we can all draw from!
