\problem

{\large The remote is out of battery or you need to save camera battery and keep WiFi turned off. \par}

If you are shooting all day in the wilderness and can only pack so many backup batteries, then leave the WiFi off on all the cameras. This will save power however you will not be able to control them with a WiFi remote. 


\solution

{\large Manually trigger the cameras. \par}

Turn the cameras on and hit record one by one. Duck duck goose! Double check that all the cameras are rolling. If you left the sound indicators on you will hear a beep for each camera you turn on and also check that all the LEDs are blinking red.
