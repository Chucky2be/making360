\problem

{\large The WiFi or Smart remote loses signal with some of the cameras when you are out of range. \par}

At the end of a take, when you come out of hiding to stop roll on all the cameras, the remote loses connection with some of the cameras.


\solution

{\large Leave the remote at the scene. \par}

Instead of waiting for the WiFi to reconnect with all the cameras, wasting time and battery power, leave the remote with the camera after starting the shot. If shooting with a tripod, you can hide the remote under the camera in the blind spot. After the coast is clear and the take is complete you can come back to the camera and hit the remote which will still be connected to all the cameras.
