\problem

{\large You have multiple rigs in the scene and want to control them individually. \par}

\solution

{\large Pair one WiFi or Smart remote per rig. \par}


Pair the cameras to a remote and apply per rig. Remember to label or color code. Now you can control the different heads individually. Once the cameras in a rig are paired to a remote, they will stay paired to that specific remote. Label the remote that corresponds to each rig so they do not get mixed up.
