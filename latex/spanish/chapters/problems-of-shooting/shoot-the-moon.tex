\problem

{\large You are using a tripod but don’t want it in the shot. \par}

Sure you can patch in a logo to cover the tripod legs, but ads are lame. 


\solution

{\large Shoot the nadir or zenith for replacement. \par}

Bring an extra camera to shoot the floor for replacement later. If possible, you will want this camera to be the same model and settings as the cameras in your rig. Otherwise the camera will have to be warped differently than the rest of the cameras in the rig. If you are using a cylindrical rig, you can also capture the sky. The information can then be composited in post production.

Position the camera as close as possible to the nodal point of the 360 rig. Point it at the zenith or nadir hole. If you have the camera on a pole, then you can hold the camera out and have a partner move the camera rig while you shoot a still or 10 second video. Then place the rig back in the same position.
